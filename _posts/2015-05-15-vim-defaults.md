Recently I was exploring the wonderful world of the VIM text editor. If you want a good laugh at how tight (and strange) the developer community can be, take a quick look at the Vim master <a href="https://twitter.com/tpope" target="_blank">Tim Pope</a>. Just be forewarned, some of his content is definitely crass.

In any case, my many terminals became quite cluttered with various settings and I realized I needed a reasonable set of defaults. But more than that, I wanted to learn how to set them up myself.

This post, as a result, will most likely grow over time. However, for the time being I have compiled all my defaults and an install script here:
