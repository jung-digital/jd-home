It has finally happened: time and many salary positions have pushed me to the place where I desire to venture onto my own as a contractor.

While I do enjoy the positions I have held, the experience of others has taught me that there is a special satisfaction that comes from having your own venture, of feeling a business grow under your feet. And that is the desire I now have and plan to pursue.

The purpose of this site will be:
<ul>
	<li>List services</li>
	<li>Demonstrate projects and results</li>
	<li>Educate with tutorials in various technologies</li>
	<li>Interface with clients</li>
</ul>
All the best, and reach out to me with any questions. As a full stack developer there are few programming and development tasks I cannot tackle.
